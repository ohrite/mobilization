Saturday was the 49th anniversary of the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision, but abortion rights activists are concerned that it may be the last. The decision’s anniversary is a popular day for advocates to rally around the United States, and Radical Women Arizona hosted their “Rally for Roe” in downtown Phoenix.
