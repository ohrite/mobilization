Protestors gathered outside the Sandra Day O’Connor U.S. Courthouse in downtown Phoenix in support of reproductive justice early morning on Dec. 1, the first day the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments of the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization case, which could overturn the individual, constitutional right to an abortion.
