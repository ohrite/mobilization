<p>On Wednesday, May 19, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed into law Senate Bill 8
(SB8), a measure that prohibits in Texas abortions as early as six weeks â€” before most
women know they are pregnant. The signing of the bill opens a new battle ground over
abortion restrictions with first-of-its-kind legal provisions intended to make the law
harder to block.</p>
